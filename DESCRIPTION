Description: The package delegate allows you to delegate some functions execution to the iExec decentralized Cloud while maintaining a total privacy of all the data used during the computation and its result.
    All of the data used is encrypted before it is sent to the iExec worker. During the execution, the TEE provided by iExec make sure the computation is kept private. Once done, the data is encrypted again before it is being sent back to the requester.
